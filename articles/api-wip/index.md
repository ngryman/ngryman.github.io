# API

Goal is to reduce the API surface enough to be concise, not to much or less (quote from video).

Arguments juggling is a sport, everyone does it but repeat itself over and over. As design patterns to handle given problems, overrides and arguments juggling should have their patterns too.
When a user discovers a new API, he should be directly confortable and nearly guess any method signature and behavior.

setters / getters usually have the same signature at one argument.
getters return the second argument of setters.
By convention they can be the same method keeping this behavior in mind.

- Mapping something they know already to something you them to understand. Design a "pit of success".
- principles, not rules.
  - unity & harmony: unfiy, familiarity and comfort for the user.
  - balance: serve a purpose. weight and predictability.
  - proportion: targeted scope. not doing to much.
  - emphasis: focal point, levels of complexity. successful entry point, fluent, hooks...
